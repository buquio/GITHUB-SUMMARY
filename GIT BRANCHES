METHOD 1
(better mthd)
// TO MERGE IN MAIN-BARNCH FIRST CREATE & CD TO BUQUIO-BRANCH 
1.create branch: 
-git branch buquio 
2.cd into the branch:
-git checkout buquio
note:to copy the main branch into your buquio branch then do next
3.MAKE SURE u have done git add., git commit & git push on the main-branch
4.merge
-git merge main
5. do ur coding and changes then:
-git add .
6.commit changes
-git commit -m "buquio commit"
7.push to buquio-branch
- (1st time)git push --set-upstream origin buquio OR(other times) git push origin buquio


**you can create, switch to dev branch,merge & push to dev branch 
-git branch dev
-git checkout dev

METHOD 2
(avoid this mthd: git checkout -b)
//If you are working on MAIN BRANCH AND YOU WANT TO CREATE BUQUIO-BARNCH & also COPY all what is in MAIN-BRANCH into BUQUIO-BARNCH at the same time.
NOTE ALWAYS REMEMBER TO DO git add & git commit on the MAIN-branch  before this
-git checkout -b buquio: 
-this create a new branch,cd into the new branch & pull everything from the MAIN-branch into BUQUIO-branch.

7.To delete a branch
Git will not let you delete the branch you are currently on so you must make sure to checkout a branch that you are NOT deleting. 
-For example: git checkout master
-Delete a branch with: git branch -d <branch>.
