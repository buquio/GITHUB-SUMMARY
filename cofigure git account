Configure your Git username/email
You typically configure your global username and email address after installing Git. However, you can do so now if you missed that step or want to make changes. After you set your global configuration, repository-specific configuration is optional.

Git configuration works the same across Windows, macOS, and Linux.

To set your global username/email configuration:
Open the command line.
Set your username:
git config --global user.name "FIRST_NAME LAST_NAME"
Set your email address:
git config --global user.email "MY_NAME@example.com"


To set repository-specific username/email configuration:
From the command line, change into the repository directory.
Set your username:
git config user.name "FIRST_NAME LAST_NAME"
Set your email address:
git config user.email "MY_NAME@example.com"

Verify your configuration by displaying your configuration file:
cat .git/config
Update your configuration from Sourcetree
Sourcetree adds your name and email address to your configuration files automatically when you log in with your Atlassian account. Use these steps if you'd like to update your global username/email or add a repository-specific username/email. After you set your global configuration, repository-specific configuration is optional.

To set your global username/email configuration:
(macOS) From the Sourcetree menu, select Preferences.
(Windows) From the Tools menu, select Options.
Select the General tab if it's not already selected.
Under Default user information, update your Full name and Email address.
